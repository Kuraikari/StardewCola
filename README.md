## Introduction
### What is StardewCola?
StardewCola is (currently) a content pack that adds various items to the game. Everything is related to making cola products.
The idea was originally to give the players simply a machine to craft cola from vanilla objects, but the initial concept didn't appeal to me
so I wanted to make it a bit bigger. That's why I started to add a Kola Nut Tree Saplings and Kola Nut as items and the associated Kola Nut Tree as a fuit tree.
After that I wanted to make the process of creating cola a bit more complex and give the ability to not only give one kind of cola product.
This is why I didn't add 1 machine, but a total of 4 different machines. While the first three are to first grind the Kola Nut, then moisturize it and bottling it
into a base form, the last one uses that base form to create different flavors.

So what IS StardewCola? It's a mod that give some more depth when it comes to cola it will be an alternative way to create money, not only using crops, fishing, etc.,
but also creating your own set of soft drinks and other kind of cola themed and based products.
The mod also adds several quests a new map and a new NPC, which will unlock the recipies for the machines for you, when you finish her tasks.
